# Get Started

You can get started with the first module of the course, [here](https://github.com/eugenp/REST-With-Spring/tree/module1).

Note that the code for each course module is hosted on its own branch, you'll have to switch to the branch corresponding to the module you're on, for example: `git checkout module1`

For more details, here's [the main Readme](https://github.com/eugenp/REST-With-Spring/wiki) of the project.
